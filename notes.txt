Jaccard Index (Jaccard similarity coefficient)

Given two objects, A and B, each with n binary attributes, the Jaccard coefficient is a useful measure of the overlap that A and B share with their attributes. Each attribute of A and B can either be 0 or 1. The total number of each combination of attributes for both A and B are specified as follows:

M_{11} represents the total number of attributes where A and B both have a value of 1.
M_{01} represents the total number of attributes where the attribute of A is 0 and the attribute of B is 1.
M_{10} represents the total number of attributes where the attribute of A is 1 and the attribute of B is 0.
M_{00} represents the total number of attributes where A and B both have a value of 0.

Each attribute must fall into one of these four categories, meaning that
M_{11} + M_{01} + M_{10} + M_{00} = n.
The Jaccard similarity coefficient, J, is given as
J = M11 / (M01 + M10 + M11)

0 < J < 1
